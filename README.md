seo4ajax-monitor
================

Little script to get the pending captures on multiple seo4ajax sites

The config file contains:
* List of sites to monitor (the uuid in seo4ajax)
* The cookie. You can get it from the requests send to seo4ajax from the browser. Just stick it there. Its something like 's%3Aj%3A%7B%22mail%22%3A%22etcetcetc'
